B.	This Agreement is being entered into for the purposes of organizing and establishing the governance and operations of the Org and the rights and obligations of membership in the Org.

## THE AGREEMENT

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby covenant and agree as follows:

1.	ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

1.1	Terms and Conditions of Membership.

(a)	Nature of Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the Org’s limited liability company agreement (as defined in the Delaware LLC Act).

(b)	Governing Terms. All rights, powers and obligations of the Members relating to the Org shall be governed and determined in accordance with: (i) the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (ii) the Delaware LLC Act.

(c)	Relationship of this Agreement to the Delaware LLC Act. To the extent that: (i) any provision of the Delaware LLC Act provides that such provision or any right, power or obligation specified therein or in the Delaware LLC Act shall apply “unless otherwise provided in a limited liability company agreement” or words of similar import or Delaware law permits a limited liability company agreement to restrict or expand any provision of the Delaware LLC Act and (ii) this Agreement directly or indirectly provides otherwise with respect to the subject matter of such provision or such right, power or obligation, then such subject matter, right, power or obligation shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement and not such provision of the Delaware LLC Act.

 
.

1.2	Name of Org The name of the Org shall be [[DAO LLC Name]] or such other name as may be determined from time to time in accordance with this Agreement.

1.3	Place of Business; Registered Office. The Org has no fixed offices or place of business. The Org’s activities are directed, controlled, and coordinated primarily through the Designated Blockchain Network and other electronic communications networks by Members located throughout the world. The registered office and registered agent of the Org required by the Delaware LLC Act to be maintained in the State of Delaware shall be the office and registered agent named in the Certificate or such other office (which need not be a place of business of the Org) or registered agent as may be designated from time to time in accordance with this Agreement.

1.4	Purposes. The purposes and business of the Org shall be to engage in any other lawful acts or activities for which limited liability companies may be organized under the Delaware LLC Act, as determined from time to time in accordance with this Agreement.

1.5	Term. The term and existence of the Org commenced upon the filing of the Certificate and shall respectively continue until the dissolution, if any, of the Org and cancellation of the Certificate, if ever, in accordance with this Agreement.

1.6	Tax Partnership. The Members intend that the Org shall be treated as a partnership for federal and, if applicable, state or local income tax purposes; each Member and the Org shall file all tax returns and shall otherwise take all tax and financial reporting positions in a manner consistent with such treatment.

1.7	Securities Law Partnership. The Members intend that the Org shall be treated as a partnership for federal and, if applicable, state or local securities law purposes; each Member and the Org shall actively participate in the management and entrepreneurial efforts of the Org in a manner consistent with such treatment.

1.8	Not An Investment Company. The Org is not intended to be or become an Entity required to register as an “investment company” as defined in Section 3(a)(1)(A) the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). The Org is intended to be a private investment company exempt from such registration requirements pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act, which exempts from registration an Entity the outstanding securities of which are beneficially owned by not more than 100 Persons and that is not making and does not presently to propose to make a public offering of its securities. Each Member shall manage the Org in a manner that will not cause the Org to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, including by limiting the number of Members to 100 Persons (with certain exceptions, such as “knowledgeable persons” as defined in the Investment Company Act) and not making or proposing to make a public offering of any of its Membership Interests or other securities.
 
1.9	Illegal Distributions; Maintaining Sufficient Net Assets For Member Exits. §18-607 of the Delaware LLC Act provides as follows:

A limited liability company shall not make a distribution to a member to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the limited liability company, other than liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specified property of the limited liability company, exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited liability company, except that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the limited liability company only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability. For purposes of this subsection (a), the term “distribution” shall not include amounts constituting reasonable compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary course of business pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits program.

Accordingly, in order to preserve the Members’ right of “free exit” by allowing for Org Property to be legally distributable to Members upon exit by means of the Designated Smart Contracts, the Org is intended to be managed in a such a manner that the Org does not maintain Liabilities. Nevertheless, the Org may from time to time incur Liabilities. Accordingly, each Member, prior to exercising an exit or redeeming another Member’s interests, shall use reasonable care to ensure that the resulting distributions of Org Property will not cause the Liabilities of the Org to exceed the fair value of the remaining Org Property. In the event that a Member knowingly receives a distribution in violation of §18-607 of the Delaware LLC Act, such Member may be personally liable to return the relevant Org Property or the fair value thereof to the Org or a creditor of the Org.

Except as set forth in Section 5.2 or Section 5.4, no Member shall directly or indirectly sell, transfer, assign, pledge, mortgage, exchange, hypothecate, grant a security interest in, or otherwise directly or indirectly dispose of or encumber any Membership Interests or Shares or any direct or indirect record or beneficial economic, voting or other interest therein or right with respect thereto (including by operation of law) or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding providing for any of the foregoing (each transaction described in this Section 5.1, a “Transfer”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Member providing any other Person with, or a Person otherwise obtaining, access to, a copy of or knowledge of the private key controlling such Member’s member address shall be automatically deemed a prohibited “Transfer” of such Member’s Membership Interests and Shares, as applicable, unless the Org has been furnished with a written and signed legal agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Members, binding such other Person to only use private key under the personal supervision of and in accordance with specific instructions from such Member. For purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code and any similar state statute, Membership Interests and Shares are nonnegotiable and are not subject to Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code.

5.2	Exception for Inheritance. Notwithstanding Section 5.1, but subject to the other clauses of this Section 5.2, a Member’s economic rights in its Membership Interest may be Transferred as a result of such Member’s death to:

(a)	such Member’s spouse;

(b)	any of such Member’s lineal descendants or antecedents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews (including adoptive relationships and step relationships); or

(c)	any of the lineal descendants or antecedents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews of Member’s spouse or domestic partner. shall be exempt from the restriction set forth in Section 5.1.

For the avoidance of doubt, such Transfer shall be solely a transfer of the economic rights with respect to the Member’s Membership Interests,  and shall not entitle the Transferee to become a Member or to receive or exercise any voting, informational, managerial or other rights or powers of a Member. All non-economic rights and powers of a Person who was a Member at the time of such Person’s death shall automatically and without further action of any Person be deemed terminated, cancelled, null and void upon such Person’s death. As promptly as reasonably practicable after learning of the death of a Member who held Shares, the other Members shall cause such Member to be exited with the result that such Member’s Shares are converted or redeemed for Tokens.

5.3	Unpermitted Transfers Are Void Or Solely Of Economic Interests. Any Transfer or purported or attempted Transfer in violation or contravention this Section 5 shall be void ab initio and of no force or effect. In the event that any restriction on Transfer set forth herein is unenforceable under applicable Legal Requirement such that a prohibited Transfer is nevertheless given legal effect (an “Unavoidable Transfer”), then, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, such Transfer shall be solely a transfer of the economic rights with respect to the Membership Interests, and shall not entitle the Transferee to become a Member or to receive or exercise any voting, informational, managerial or other rights or powers of a Member, and all such non-economic rights and powers of the Transferring Member shall automatically and without further action of any Person be deemed terminated, cancelled, null and void.

5.4	Redemptions of Membership Interests.

(a)	Exits.

(i)	Each Member may at any time, as permitted by the Designated Governance Smart Contract, voluntarily and irrevocably cause all or a portion of the Member’s Membership Interests represented in the form of Shares to be redeemed by the Org. A successful call in this manner is referred to in this Agreement as a “RageQuit.”

(ii)	In exchange for the redeemed Membership Interests of a RageQuitting Member, such Member shall be entitled to receive only the following:

(A)	such Member’s Economic Membership Interest Percentage of each Token held in their account of the Designated Governance Smart Contract at the time of the RageQuti; and

(B)	if any of the Org Property is not either a Token or legally represented by a Token allocated in the account of the Designated Governance Smart Contract, the Member’s Economic Membership Interest Percentage of such other Org Property; provided, however, that this clause “(B)” shall not apply to, and no Member shall have any right or entitlement to, any intellectual property, information, files, servers, computer system, accounts (such as web, app, bank, brokerage or other accounts), real property title or leases, insurance policies, Contracts, Consents, permits or other non-cash and non-investment assets included in the Org Property or that is necessary or desirable for the general conduct of the Org’s business or operations (for example, the logo of the Org, the name and any DBAs of the Org, trademarks and other branding of the Org, licenses to another Person’s intellectual property held by the Org, email accounts of the Org, AWS accounts of the Org, websites of the Org, etc.), which shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Org unless provided otherwise in a license or assignment agreement from the Org to one or more Members that is approved by the Members in an Extraordinary Proposal.

(iii)	Transfer of ownership of the Org Property to which a Member or former Member is entitled pursuant to the preceding clause “(ii)” of this Section 5.4(a) shall be made solely as follows:

(A)	the Designated Governance Smart Contract shall allocate the Tokens to which such Member or former Member is so entitled to such Member or former Member by transferring such Tokens to the account of the Member, and such allocation shall be deemed a complete and final assignment and transfer of all of the Org’s right, title and ownership in and to such Tokens to such Member or former Member, regardless of whether or when such Member or former Member actually withdraws or receives possession or control of such Tokens; 

(B)	the Members or their designated representatives shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Org to allocate, set aside and hold in trust for such Member or former Member any other Org Property to which such Member or former Member is so entitled, and such allocation shall be deemed a complete and final assignment, transfer and conveyance of all right, title and ownership in and to such Org Property to such Member or former Member, and such setting aside and holding in trust shall be deemed a complete and final assignment and transfer of all of the Org’s right, title and ownership in and to such Org Property to such Member or former Member, regardless of whether or when such Member or former Member actually collects or receives possession or control of such Org Property; and

(C)	the Members or their designated representatives shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Org to distribute to or make available for collection by such Member or former Member any other Org Property to which such Member or former Member is so entitled by any commercially reasonable means; provided, however, that any fees, costs or other expenses of such conveyance shall be borne exclusively by such Member or former Member, and either: (1) such fees, costs or other expenses (or the fair value thereof) may be deducted and withheld by the Org from such Org Property as a setoff to the amounts otherwise payable to such Member or former Member or (B) the Org may delay conveyance of such Org Property and continue to hold such Org Property in trust pursuant to the preceding clause of this Section 5.4(a) until such Member or former Member has advanced to the Org any such fees, costs and other expenses the Org has reasonably requested that such Member or former Member pay.

(iv)	For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to Section 2.3(b), a Member who has Ragequit with respect to all of the Member’s Shares shall cease to be a Member.

(v)	The allocation of the Tokens and other Org Property to a RageQuitting Member in accordance with this clause “(iii)” shall be deemed full, final and fair payment for the Member’s Membership Interests and Shares, equal to or greater than the fair market value thereof, and such a redemption and fair market value shall be deemed final, binding and non- appealable by the RageQuitting Member and all other Members and the Org, and shall not be contested by or on behalf of any of them except to the extent permitted by Section 1.10(c). THE MEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE DESIGNATED GOVERNANCE SMART CONTRACT AND ANY OTHER SMART CONTRACTS GOVERNING THE ALLOCATION AND TRANSFER OF THE TOKENS ARE AUTONOMOUS PERSISTENT SCRIPTS RUNNING PERMISSIONLESSLY AND FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES UNALTERABLY ON THE DESIGNATED BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK AND ARE NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE MEMBERS OR THE ORG. ACCORDINGLY, THE MEMBERS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ABILITY OF A MEMBER TO RECEIVE OR WITHDRAW TOKENS CANNOT BE GUARANTEED, AND ALL RISK OF NON- DELIVERY OR NON-RECEIPT OF THE TOKENS TO WHICH A MEMBER IS OR MAY BECOME ENTITLED SHALL BE BORNE EXCLUSIVELY BY AND IS HEREBY FULLY AND VOLUNTARILY ASSUMED BY SUCH MEMBER. 

No failure or delay on the part of a Member or former Member to receive or withdraw from Designated Governance Smart Contract the Tokens allocated to such Member or to collect or otherwise receive possession of the other Org Property allocated to such Member shall be deemed to invalidate, void, reverse, delay, revoke or otherwise limit the redemption of such Member’s Membership Interests and Shares.

(b)	GuildKicks. Each Member may at any time make a Proposal to exit or redeem another Member’s interests in the Org. A GuildKick (defined below) Proposal that is approved by the Members will expel another Member from the Org by causing all of such Member’s Shares or similar interests to be redeemed by the Org through the Designated Governance Smart Contract. There shall be no prohibition or limit, by virtue of conflict or interest or otherwise, on a Member voting or refraining from voting in any manner (Yes, No, or abstaining) on a GuildKick Proposal relating to the Member’s own expulsion. If a GuildKick Proposal is approved by the Members (referred to as a “GuildKick”), all of the GuildKicked Member’s Shares shall be redeemed by the Org, mutatis mutandis.

(c)	Alternative Redemption Mechanics in Material Adverse Exception Event. If there is a Material Adverse Exception Event affecting the use of the Designated Governance Smart Contract as set forth in this Section 5.4, the Members or their designated representatives shall use reasonable best efforts to create temporary emergency mechanisms approximately, as nearly as reasonably practicable under the circumstances, the relevant mechanisms of the Designated Governance Smart Contract. Such mechanisms shall replace the mechanisms of the Designated Governance Smart Contract set forth in the other provisions of this  Section 5.4 until such Material Adverse Exception Event is cured.

6.	DISSOLUTION AND WINDING UP.

6.1	No Automatic Dissolutions. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 6, the Org is intended to have perpetual existence. The admission of any additional Member(s), the expulsion or resignation of any Member(s), or the death, or the retirement, expulsion, bankruptcy or dissolution of any Member(s), shall not in itself cause or require a dissolution of the Org.

6.2	Dissolution. The Org shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up upon the first to occur of the following: (a) upon approval by the Members of a Liquidation Proposal providing for the dissolution and winding up the affairs of the Org; and (b) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Org under §18-802 of the Delaware LLC Act or an administrative dissolution under §18-802 of the Delaware LLC Act.

6.3	Liquidation and Termination. On the dissolution of the Org, the Members or their designated representatives shall act as liquidators or may appoint one or more other Persons to act as liquidators. The liquidators shall proceed diligently to wind up the affairs of the Org and make final distributions as provided herein and in the Delaware LLC Act. The costs of liquidation shall be borne as an expense of the Org. Until final distribution, the liquidators shall continue to operate the Org with all of the power and authority of the Members. The steps to be accomplished by the liquidators are as follows:

(a)	The liquidators shall use reasonable best efforts to pay, satisfy or discharge from funds of the Org all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Org (including, without limitation, all expenses incurred in liquidation) or otherwise make adequate provision for payment and discharge thereof (including, without limitation, the establishment of a cash fund for contingent liabilities in such amount and for such term as the liquidators may reasonably determine).
 
(b)	As promptly as reasonably practicable after dissolution, the liquidators shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Members to be GuildKicked with the result that all Tokens under the control of the Designated Governance Smart Contract are distributed pro rata to the Members in accordance with their Membership Interests.

(c)	The distribution of cash and/or property to a Member in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6 constitutes a complete return to the Member of its Capital Contributions and a complete distribution to the Member of its interest in the Org and all Org property and constitutes a compromise to which all Members have consented within the meaning of the Delaware LLC Act. To the extent that a Member returns funds to the Org, it has no claim against any other Member for those funds.

6.4	Cancellation of Certificate. On completion of the distribution of Org assets and all other activities necessary for the winding-up of the Org as provided herein, the Org shall be terminated (and the Org shall not be terminated prior to such time), and the liquidators shall file a certificate of cancellation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, cancel any other filings made pursuant to this Agreement that are or should be canceled, and take such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Org. The Org shall be deemed to continue in existence for all purposes of this Agreement until it is terminated pursuant to this Section 6 .4.

6.5	Reasonable Time for Winding Up. A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding up of the business and affairs of the Org and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to Section 6.3 in order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding up.

6.6	No Personal Liability of Liquidators. The liquidators shall not be personally liable for the return of Capital Contributions or any portion thereof to the Members (it being understood that any such return shall be made solely from Org assets

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the definitions that are ascribed to them in the Agreement, which you should have received a copy of.

1.	BUSINESS/OPERATIONAL RISKS

[[DAO LLC Name]] has no operating history. [[DAO LLC Name]] may need to raise additional capital in the future to continue operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.

[[DAO LLC Name]] is a recently formed company established under the laws of the State of Delaware with minimal activity and no historical operating results. There is no guarantee that [[DAO LLC Name]] will be able to raise any additional capital in the future or that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms. [[DAO LLC Name]] generally lacks any ability to raise certain kinds of capital (e.g., debt) and may not have the ability to finance capital expenditures or finance strategic initiatives.

Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objectives. Our proposed operations are subject to all business risks associated with a new enterprise. The likelihood of our creation of a viable business must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the inception of a business operating in a relatively new, highly competitive, and developing industry. There can beno assurance that we will ever generate any operating activity or develop and operate the business as planned. If we are unsuccessful at executing on our business plan, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and investors may lose all or a substantial portion of their investment.

[[DAO LLC Name]] may be unable to recover assets for which the associated cryptographic key is lost, stolen, or destroyed. Stolen cryptographic keys may be used to improperly influence [[DAO LLC Name]]’s activities.

Responsibility for the safekeeping of digital assets including the cryptographic keys associated with blockchain-based assets rests solely on the individual Members. [[DAO LLC Name]] is generally incapable of recovering any assets associated with a lost or destroyed cryptographic key. Such loss or destruction would result in the total loss of any investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

In the event a cryptographic key is stolen or duplicated, the thief may gain access to assets of [[DAO LLC Name]], including the ability to create or approve new proposals related to [[DAO LLC Name]]’s business. This may have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

[[DAO LLC Name]] may suffer from misaligned incentives, adverse selection, and related effects through the operation of Designated Smart Contracts and inapplicability of fiduciary duties.

[[DAO LLC Name]] is designed to coordinate its operations through its Members’ individual economic incentives. Individual Members are expected to source investment opportunities and conduct required due diligence.

However, it is possible that the incentive structure produced by the Designated Smart Contracts may ultimately impede effective coordination of the Members. Members are not subject to fiduciary duties to one another or to [[DAO LLC Name]]. As such, Members may retain favorable investment opportunities for themselves, or cause [[DAO LLC Name]] to make unfavorable investments or disbursements. Members may also promote investment opportunities in which they have significant, independent financial stakes. For example, a Member holding large quantities of a specific type of token or other investment asset may promote investments which would not be expected to accrue value for other Members, but which would increase the value of such token or other investment asset. This may have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Liquidated assets may lose value or become unmarketable.

Although the RageQuit functionality permits each Member to withdraw a pro-rated distribution of [[DAO LLC Name]]’s assets, those assets may subsequently lose value or become illiquid or unmarketable due to market conditions or legal requirements. This may have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

[[DAO LLC Name]]’s governance functions, including Designated Smart Contracts, may become captured by a hostile Member or group of Members.

[[DAO LLC Name]]’s governance is primarily executed through its Designated Smart Contracts and the votes of its Members. It is possible that an individual Member or group of Members (the “attackers”) may cause [[DAO LLC Name]] to issue new Membership Interests (whether in the form of Shares or similar interests) or otherwise approve proposals for the benefit of the attackers. This may result in the dilution of other Members’ investments in [[DAO LLC Name]], misappropriation of the assets of [[DAO LLC Name]], or other harms which may have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Members may be subject to the GuildKick functionality of Designated Smart Contracts, which may result in foregone investment opportunities.

Continued Membership in [[DAO LLC Name]] is conditioned on the ongoing consent of an economic majority of the other Members. A Member may be forcibly removed from [[DAO LLC Name]] through the GuildKick functionality of the Designated Smart Contracts. In this event, the ejected Member will receive a pro-rated distribution of [[DAO LLC Name]]’s assets, but will forfeit any ability to influence or participate in future investment decisions of [[DAO LLC Name]]. Depending on the availability of present or subsequent investment opportunities at that time, an ejected Member may ultimately be required to forego favorable investment opportunities. The ongoing possibility of such ejection constitutes a material risk of investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Oracles used to determine the exchange rate or value of [[DAO LLC Name]]’s assets may become captured or otherwise manipulated to provide false information that could be exploited by a Member or external adversary.

The Designated Smart Contracts, or smart contracts on which the Designated Smart Contracts depend, may rely on external sources of information (“Oracles”) to determine asset valuations and exchange rates or to maintain price stability of an asset. It is possible that an entity could capture or manipulate an oracle to inject false information. The ongoing possibility of an Oracle producing such false information constitutes a material risk of investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Addition or subtraction of new Members may dilute the ownership interests of existing Members in [[DAO LLC Name]]’s assets.

It is possible to acquire Membership Interests in [[DAO LLC Name]] for a range of types and amounts of other assets. Accordingly, acceptance of a new Member may change the overall kind and number of assets beneficially owned by individual Members. This may result in the dilution of other Members’ investments in [[DAO LLC Name]] or other harms which may have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Entities receiving investment or funding from [[DAO LLC Name]] are not under the control of [[DAO LLC Name]]. Such projects may act in a manner adverse to [[DAO LLC Name]] or its Members.

[[DAO LLC Name]] is unlikely to have effective control over any individuals or entities. There is no guarantee that an entity funded by [[DAO LLC Name]] will act in accordance with any funding agreement. Material risks include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

•	the entity may attempt to raise additional funding from other sources, causing dilution of [[DAO LLC Name]]’s investment;
•	the entity may issue different cryptographic tokens or assets, in addition to or in lieu of assets owed to [[DAO LLC Name]]; or
•	the entity may not deliver any cryptographic tokens or assets.

Accordingly, the decisions or actions of entities funded by [[DAO LLC Name]] may have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Members may not perform adequate or uniform due diligence.

Members are responsible for due diligence of investment opportunities. Members may not have the necessary expertise to perform adequate due diligence. The ultimate decision of whether to undertake any investment opportunity will be subject to a vote of the Members, notwithstanding any due diligence performed. It is possible that Members may apply incomplete or inconsistent due diligence procedures, which could result in the improper assessment of risks attending such investments. This may have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Members may not effectively source investment opportunities compared to competing entities.

Members are responsible for sourcing investment opportunities. Members may not have the necessary expertise, position, or incentive to identify and negotiate investment opportunities on behalf of [[DAO LLC Name]]. It is possible that Members will be unable to identify favorable investment opportunities, which may have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Additionally, [[DAO LLC Name]] expects intense competition for limited investment opportunities. Competitors may include investment companies and investment advisers including pension funds and hedge funds, technology firms, and others. These competitors may have fewer financial, legal, and technological constraints. They may also have greater name recognition or established good will. [[DAO LLC Name]]’s ability to compete will depend on the capabilities and actions of its Members, for which [[DAO LLC Name]] can offer no assurances.

[[DAO LLC Name]] does not have D&O indemnification or other insurance, does not intend to seek such insurance and may be unable to obtain such insurance on commercially reasonable terms. Consequently, [[DAO LLC Name]] itself or its members could be exposed to losses.

[[DAO LLC Name]] does not have and does not presently intend to seek insurance that would cover Members against claims for damages by third parties other Members or by [[DAO LLC Name]], or that would cover [[DAO LLC Name]] against claims for damages by Members or third parties. In the event that Members wished to obtain such insurance, such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, due to the novel governance features of [[DAO LLC Name]]. Consequently, in the event that Members or [[DAO LLC Name]] face such litigation, insurance will not be available, and any losses suffered by Members or [[DAO LLC Name]] will be uninsured.

2.	LEGAL/REGULATORY RISK

It is intended that the Members who hold Shares be general partners in [[DAO LLC Name]] for securities law purposes, as a result of which [[DAO LLC Name]] Members will not have the protections of the securities laws in purchasing or divesting themselves of their Shares.

Although [[DAO LLC Name]] is a company and thus not a “general partnership” under U.S. state laws regarding unincorporated associations, Members who hold Shares have the rights, powers and responsibilities of general managers of [[DAO LLC Name]], have the right to vote on all decisions of [[DAO LLC Name]], and may exit freely prior to the implementation of proposals they voted against. Accordingly, for securities law purposes, it is intended that Members holding shares be viewed as general partners of one another in the management of [[DAO LLC Name]]. A general partnership interest is generally presumed not to be a security under the U.S. federal securities acts; accordingly, [[DAO LLC Name]] Members may not, and should assume that they do not, have the protections of the U.S. federal securities laws in their investment decision to acquire or divest themselves of Shares. As a result, [[DAO LLC Name]] Members will not have the remedies against [[DAO LLC Name]] that would be available if Shares were securities—such as a right of rescission for failure to register the offering of Shares.

It is possible that Members may, individually or collectively, cause [[DAO LLC Name]] to require registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, with which [[DAO LLC Name]] would be unable to comply.

The Investment Company Act of 1940 exempts from registration entities with fewer than 100 beneficial owners of securities held by the entity. Although [[DAO LLC Name]] is designed not to be or become an entity required to register as an “investment company”, it is possible that Members may act outside the limitations established by the Grimoire and Designated Smart Contracts. A Member may, for example, transfer control of a Designated Blockchain Network Account Address to another natural person or group of natural persons, in violation of the Grimoire’s prohibition on such actions, thereby triggering registration requirements under the Investment Company Act.

In the event registration is required, it may be impossible or infeasible for [[DAO LLC Name]] to comply with relevant laws and regulations pertaining to the registration, recordkeeping, and oversight of [[DAO LLC Name]]. In addition, it may not be possible for [[DAO LLC Name]] to become aware of such an event, so that Members may not be able to RageQuit in order to avoid liability for violations of the Investment Company Act. This could have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

[[DAO LLC Name]] may inadvertently issue non-voting shares triggering regulatory requirements under the Investment Advisers Act that [[DAO LLC Name]] may be unable to comply with.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration, or exemption from registration, any entity that engages in the business of advising others as to the value or advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities. Members of [[DAO LLC Name]] may cause the issuance of non-voting shares which may cause [[DAO LLC Name]] to be subject to the Investment Advisers Act. The Investment Advisers Act may impose restrictions on the activities of [[DAO LLC Name]], including substantive prohibitions, contractual requirements, recordkeeping requirements, and regulatory oversight and examination.

In such an event, [[DAO LLC Name]]’s compliance with the Investment Advisers Act may be impossible or infeasible, and may require extraordinary response up to and including liquidation of [[DAO LLC Name]]. It may be impossible for [[DAO LLC Name]] produce a faithful disclosure of material facts or conflicts of interest. It may be impossible to prevent principal transactions.

Sales of Shares may be securities transactions requiring registration.

The Securities Act of 1933 requires that securities transactions be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The sale of Shares or other assets of [[DAO LLC Name]] may be deemed securities transactions requiring registration unless subject to an exemption from registration.

In such an event, it may be impossible or infeasible for [[DAO LLC Name]] to comply with regulatory requirements associated with these securities transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Shares may not be tradeable on secondary markets.

In order to preserve exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and Investment Company Act, Shares of [[DAO LLC Name]] may generally not be traded. The ability of Members to dispose of the Shares may be limited to redemption of Shares through the RageQuit function of the Designated Smart Contracts. Any such liquidation would distribute Org assets to the exiting Member in kind. Both Shares and underlying assets may not be marketable due to legal restrictions, which may prevent a Member from recovering part or all of the Member’s investment.

As a result of its reliance on the Designated Smart Contracts, [[DAO LLC Name]] or one of its Members may become subject to a legal order or other requirement that permanently or temporarily prohibits or restrains [[DAO LLC Name]] from executing a function it would otherwise reasonably be expected to execute, or that mandates or directs [[DAO LLC Name]] to take an action it would otherwise not reasonably be expected to perform, which [[DAO LLC Name]] or such Member may be incapable of complying with.

As a result of its reliance on the Designated Smart Contracts, which cannot be modified after they are deployed, [[DAO LLC Name]] or one of its Members may become subject to a legal order or other requirement for which compliance is impossible or infeasible. [[DAO LLC Name]] may not have Member or agent capable of executing a legal order or requirement. Noncompliance could result in legal liability that would have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

[[DAO LLC Name]] may be deemed a Money Services Business requiring State and Federal supervision, which [[DAO LLC Name]] may be incapable of complying with.
 
The Bank Secrecy Act imposes a requirement for money transmitters and other money services businesses (MSBs) to be licensed and supervised by the States in which they operate. It is possible that the investment of money in blockchain-mediated ventures, or the operation of [[DAO LLC Name]]’s Designated Smart Contracts in conjunction with the actions of [[DAO LLC Name]] or its individual Members, may constitute money transmission subject to licensure and supervision. In particular, the Trade functionality of the Designated Smart Contracts may be deemed exchange or transmission of money subject to State and Federal regulation.

Compliance with such licensure and supervision requirements would likely be impossible or infeasible, subjecting [[DAO LLC Name]] to legal liability. In particular, it may be impossible to maintain and implement required compliance programs including anti-money-laundering (AML) policies or participation in regulatory examinations. Noncompliance could result in legal liability that would have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

It may be impossible or infeasible to enforce legal agreements, remedies, or orders against [[DAO LLC Name]] or its Members due to the nature of blockchain technology.

Nearly all actions and decisions of [[DAO LLC Name]] are mediated by blockchain technology. Generally, blockchain technology does not permit any action not within a specific set of parameters granted by the possession of a cryptographic key. Although [[DAO LLC Name]] is a legal entity subject to the laws and courts of applicable jurisdictions, it may be impossible to enforce some legal agreements, remedies, or other orders against [[DAO LLC Name]] or individual Members due to the inherent limitations of blockchain technology. This may have a material adverse effect on the legal rights of a Member or third party, or on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

3.	BLOCKCHAIN RISK

The Blockchain Network or a Designated Smart Contract may become subject to a Material Adverse Exception Event.

Most blockchain networks operate based on open-source software. An open source project is not represented, maintained or monitored by an official organization or authority. Because of the nature of open-source software projects, it may be easier for third parties not affiliated with [[DAO LLC Name]] to introduce software vulnerabilities or bugs into the core infrastructure elements of the blockchain network. This could result in the corruption or exploitation of the open-source code including but not limited to Consensus Attacks, changes to Consensus Rules, or blockchain reorganizations, which may result in the loss or theft of blockchain-based assets and have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Similarly, it is possible that a software bug results in or permits the non-functionality or inoperability of Designated Smart Contracts or the unauthorized use of an administrative function of a Designated Smart Contract, which may result in the loss or theft of blockchain-based assets and have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Blockchain networks may be the target of malicious attacks seeking to identify and exploit weaknesses in the software. Such events may result in a loss of trust in the security and operation of blockchain networks and a decline in user activity which could have a negative impact on [[DAO LLC Name]] and its investments.

Investments may be rendered valueless due to the open-source nature of blockchain networks.

The majority of software operating on blockchain networks is open source, which generally allows third parties to produce modified duplicates of the software. To the extent [[DAO LLC Name]] funds the development of such software, it is possible that a third party may release competing software or modify the software to remove profit-generating mechanisms built into the original software. This may have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].
 
Blockchain technology is nascent and rapidly changing, and there remains minimal use of blockchain networks and blockchain assets in the retail and commercial marketplace. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks may adversely affect an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

The development of blockchain networks is a new and rapidly evolving industry that is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Factors affecting the further development of the blockchain industry include:

•	continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of blockchain networks and assets;
•	the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of blockchain networks;
•	changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;
•	the popularity or acceptance of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other networks;
•	the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;
•	government and quasi-government regulation of blockchain networks and assets, including any restrictions on access, operation and use of blockchain networks and assets; and
•	the general economic environment and conditions relating to blockchain networks and assets.

[[DAO LLC Name]]’s business model is dependent on continued investment in and development of the blockchain industry and related technologies. If investments in the blockchain industry become less attractive to investors or innovators and developers, or if blockchain networks and assets do not gain public acceptance or are not adopted and used by a substantial number of individuals, companies and other entities, it could have a material adverse impact on [[DAO LLC Name]]’s prospects and operations.

The application of distributed ledger technology is novel and untested and may contain inherent flaws or limitations.

The capabilities of blockchain technology are not fully proven in use. There are relatively few successful examples of the application of blockchain technology. In most cases, software used by entities issuing blockchain-based assets will be in an early development stage and still unproven. As with other novel software products, the computer code underpinning Shares and blockchain networks may contain errors, or function in unexpected ways. Insufficient testing of smart contract code, as well as the use of external code libraries, may cause the software to malfunction. Any error or unexpected functionality may cause a decline in value of Shares or other Org assets and result in substantial losses to purchasers of Shares.

If [[DAO LLC Name]] discovers errors or unexpected functionalities in a Designated Smart Contract after it has been deployed, [[DAO LLC Name]] may make a determination that the Designated Smart Contract is defective and that its use should be discontinued. Members may be unable to rely on [[DAO LLC Name]]’s successful performance of measures intended to restore functionality to defective Designated Smart Contracts.

The creation and operation of Designated Smart Contracts will be subject to potential technical, legal and regulatory constraints. There is no warranty that the process for receiving, use and ownership of blockchain- based assets will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software, network, assets and related technologies and theories could contain undiscovered technical flaws or weaknesses, the cryptographic security measures that authenticate transactions and the distributed ledger could be compromised, and breakdowns and trading halts could cause the partial or complete inability loss of blockchain-based assets or functionality.
 
Risks associated with the distributed ledger technology could affect [[DAO LLC Name]]’s business directly or the market for blockchain assets generally. In either case, the occurrence of these events could have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

Each blockchain network is dependent upon its users and contributors, and actions taken, or not taken, by the users or contributors of a blockchain network could damage its reputation and the reputation of blockchain networks generally.

Developers and other contributors to blockchain network protocols generally maintain or develop those blockchain networks, including the verification of transactions on such networks. Because the networks are decentralized, these contributors are generally not directly compensated by the network for their actions. Most blockchain networks provide that certain classes of contributors receive awards and transfer fees for recording transactions and otherwise maintaining the blockchain network. Such fees are generally paid in the native asset of that network.

The security and integrity of blockchain-based assets, including the value ascribed to those assets, relies on the integrity of the underlying blockchain networks. [[DAO LLC Name]]’s Designated Smart Contracts are programmed for compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain.

If the awards and fees paid for maintenance of a network are not sufficiently high to incentivize ongoing contribution to the network, individuals or entities may respond in a way that reduces confidence in the blockchain network. To the extent that any miners or validators cease to record transactions, the operations and governance of [[DAO LLC Name]] will also cease. Furthermore, any widespread delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss of confidence in the blockchain network and its assets. This could have a material adverse effect on an investment in [[DAO LLC Name]], or on [[DAO LLC Name]] itself.

The prices of blockchain-based assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin, Ether and/or other network tokens could materially and adversely affect [[DAO LLC Name]].

The prices of assets such as Bitcoin and Ether have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile. As relatively new products and technologies, blockchain-based assets are not widely accepted as a means of payment for goods and services. A significant portion of demand for these assets is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of blockchain assets.

In addition, some blockchain industry participants have reported that a significant percentage of trading activity on blockchain networks is artificial or non-economic in nature and may represent attempts to manipulate the price of certain assets. Trading platforms and blockchain developers are incentivized to artificially inflate trading volumes so that their platform or asset rises in league tables and gains prominence in the industry. As a result, trading platforms or blockchain assets may seek to inflate demand for a specific blockchain assets, or blockchain assets generally, which could increase the volatility of that asset or blockchain asset trading prices generally.

The market price of these assets, as well as assets that may be developed in the future, may continue to be highly volatile. A lack of expansion, or a contraction of adoption and use of blockchain assets, may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the price of blockchain assets.

Several additional factors may influence the market price of blockchain assets, including, but not limited to:

•	Global blockchain asset supply;
•	Global blockchain asset demand, which can be influenced by the growth of retail merchants’ and commercial businesses’ acceptance of blockchain assets like cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, the security of online blockchain asset trading platforms and digital wallets that hold blockchain assets, the perception that the use and holding of blockchain assets is safe and secure, and the regulatory restrictions on their use;
•	Changes in the software, software requirements or hardware requirements underlying the blockchain networks;
•	Changes in the rights, obligations, incentives, or rewards for the various participants in blockchain networks;
•	The cost of trading and transacting in blockchain assets, and whether such costs may become fixed or standardized;
•	Investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;
•	Interest rates;
•	Currency exchange rates, including the rates at which blockchain assets may be exchanged for fiat currencies;
•	Fiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies of blockchain asset trading platforms and liquidity on such platforms;
•	Interruptions in service or other failures of major blockchain asset trading platforms;
•	Investment and trading activities of large investors, including private and registered funds, that may directly or indirectly invest in blockchain networks or blockchain assets;
•	Monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations;
•	Regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of blockchain assets;
•	The maintenance and development of the open-source software utilized in blockchain networks;
•	Global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; or
•	Expectations among blockchain network participants that the value of such blockchain assets will soon change.

A decrease in the price of a single blockchain asset may cause volatility in the entire blockchain industry and may affect other blockchain assets. For example, a security breach that affects investor or user confidence in Ether or Bitcoin may affect the industry as a whole and may also cause the price of other blockchain assets to fluctuate. The value of blockchain assets and fluctuations in the price of blockchain assets could materially and adversely affect any investment in [[DAO LLC Name]].

The regulatory regimes governing blockchain technologies, blockchain assets and the purchase and sale of blockchain-based assets are uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of blockchain networks and the use of blockchain assets.

As blockchain networks and blockchain assets have grown in popularity and in market size, international, Federal, State and local regulatory agencies have begun to clarify their position regarding the sale, purchase, ownership and trading of blockchain assets. However, there is growing demand among industry participants, legislators, and even regulators themselves for new or modified regulations in light of the risks and opportunities presented by blockchain technology. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries have shown that they intend to adopt legislation to regulate the sale and use of blockchain assets. Such legislation may vary significantly among jurisdictions, which may subject participants in [[DAO LLC Name]] and the greater blockchain marketplace to different and perhaps contradictory requirements.

New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, in the United States and elsewhere, may materially and adversely impact the development and growth of blockchain networks and the adoption and use of blockchain assets. The imposition of restrictions on all blockchain assets, or certain blockchain assets, could affect the value, liquidity and market price of blockchain assets. Heightened regulation may limit access to marketplaces or exchanges on which to trade such assets, or impose restrictions on the structure, rights and transferability of such assets. Some governments may seek to ban transactions in blockchain assets altogether.
 
[[DAO LLC Name]] may be prevented from entering, or may be required to cease operations in, a jurisdiction that makes it illegal or commercially unviable or undesirable to operate in such jurisdiction. Enforcement, or the threat of enforcement, may also drive a critical mass of participants and trading activity away from regulated markets. Although it is impossible to predict the positions that will be taken by certain governments, any regulatory changes affecting blockchain assets could be substantial and materially adverse to the development and growth of [[DAO LLC Name]] and its business.

The extent to which blockchain assets are used or perceived to fund criminal or terrorist enterprises or launder the proceeds of illegal activities could materially impact [[DAO LLC Name]].

The potential, or perceived potential, for anonymity in transfers of bitcoin and similar assets, as well as the decentralized nature of blockchain networks, has led some terrorist groups and other criminals to solicit bitcoins and other blockchain-based assets for capital raising purposes. As blockchain assets have grown in both popularity and market size, legislative and regulatory bodies have been examining the operations of blockchain assets, users, and exchanges, concerning the use of blockchain assets for the purpose of laundering the proceeds of illegal activities or funding criminal or terrorist enterprises.

In addition to existing networks and assets, new blockchain networks or similar technologies may be developed to provide more anonymity and less traceability. There is also the potential that other blockchain asset trading platforms may court illicit activity by not adhering to know-your-customer and anti-money laundering practices.

[[DAO LLC Name]] may not be able to prevent illegal activity from occurring using the Designated Smart Contracts. [[DAO LLC Name]] may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of a KYC/AML whitelisted Member address. Further, [[DAO LLC Name]] may be unable to verify whether cryptographic keys for wallets containing Shares have been transferred to third parties who have not completed the required KYC/AML process. Although [[DAO LLC Name]] plans to implement compliance procedures for KYC/AML obligations, [[DAO LLC Name]] may not be successful in deterring or identifying illegal activity.

The use of blockchain assets for illegal purposes, or the perception of such use, could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to [[DAO LLC Name]]’s reputation, damage to the reputation of blockchain assets generally, and a loss of confidence in the services provided by [[DAO LLC Name]] and the blockchain industry and community as a whole.

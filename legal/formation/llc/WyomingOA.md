**LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES**

**4.1 Indemnification**. The DAO LLC shall indemnify any person who was or is a party defendant or is threatened to be made a party defendant, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the DAO LLC) by reason of the fact that they are or were a Member of the DAO LLC, manager, employee, or agent of the DAO LLC, or are or were serving at the request of the DAO LLC, against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the Members determine that they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the DAO LLC, and with respect to any criminal action proceeding, have no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of "no lo Contendere" or its equivalent, shall not in itself create a presumption that the person did or did not act in good faith and in a manner which they reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the DAO LLC, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was lawful.

**4.2 Fiduciary Duties**. No Member, manager, employee, or similarly authorized agent of the DAO LLC ("***Manager***") shall be obligated personally for any debt, obligation or liability of the DAO LLC or of any Member, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, by reason of being or acting as Manager of the DAO LLC. No Manager shall be personally liable to the DAO LLC or its Members for any action undertaken or omitted in good faith reliance upon the provisions of this Agreement, and the DAO LLC shall indemnify such Managers for the same, unless the acts or omissions of the Manager were not in good faith or involved criminal activity, willful misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation or breach of this Agreement; provided, however, that each Manager shall owe, and shall act in a manner consistent with, fiduciary duties to the DAO LLC and its Members of the nature, and to the same extent, as those owed by directors of a Delaware corporation. Additionally, the DAO LLC may provide additional liability protection by entering into individual indemnification contracts with Managers. For the avoidance of doubt the DAO LLC may also enter into individual indemnification contracts with its Members, officers, employees, and agents.

There is no assurance that any exemption from registration under the Securities Act will be available, and that, even if available, such exemption may not allow Members to transfer all or any portion of the Member Tokens under the circumstances, in the amounts, or at the times that they might propose;

(ii) This Agreement has been reviewed and authorized by the existing Members; and

(iii) This Agreement constitutes legal, valid, and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their terms among the Members, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally and by general equitable principles.

**9.2.1 Death, Incompetency, or Bankruptcy of Member**. On the death, adjudicated incompetence, or bankruptcy of a Member, unless the DAO LLC exercises its rights under *Section 9.3*, the successor-in-interest to the Member (whether an estate, bankruptcy trustee, or otherwise) will receive only the economic right to receive distributions whenever made by the DAO LLC and the Member's allocable share of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit (the "***Economic Rights***") unless and until the transferee is admitted as a fully substituted Member by Member Token Votes.

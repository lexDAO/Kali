Tit. 6, § 1901) upon their lawful receipt of [[NFT MEMBERSHIP INTEREST.]] The DAO is a decentralized network of members and may admit or deny for any arbitrary purpose or lack of purpose.

All of the DAO governing members shall have their membership determined [[automatically]] upon [[lawful]] receipt of [[voting tokens]] secured on a public blockchain (“Cryptographic Units”, and such holders, “Members”). Cryptographic Units are used for participating in and improving the governance of the DAO through affirmative majority votes effectuted via the Designated Smart Contract (defined herein) (such process, “Cryptographic Consensus”). Once the admission requirements are met a prospective Member may be put up to a vote of the full membership or similar process enabled by the Designated Smart Contract. The DAO will consistently review, and if necessary, Members may make adjustments to the admission requirements based on their evolving needs and as registered in a successful vote through the Designated Smart Contract.

**Section 2.3 - Rights.** The DAO's Members shall utilize the “Designated Smart Contract” (a smart contract deployed to the Designated Blockchain at the Designated Blockchain Address) as the exclusive method of holding, allocating rights and obligations among the Members, and spending, or otherwise distributing any Tokens that are DAO Property, of minting and issuing Cryptographic Units and holding and recording votes among the Members. The DAO may also utilize the Designated Smart Contract to administer and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving the DAO, the Members and/or third parties.

Members’ rights and responsibilities are controlled by the use of the Designated Smart Contact used to conduct its governance and activities of the DAO. Members will cast votes and carry out the decisions made on the Designated Smart Contract.

Each Member shall notify the DAO of an e-mail address or other acceptable communication channel by which such Member may receive written or electronic materials required or permitted by this document or shall notify the DAO that such Member has no e-mail address and designate the mutually acceptable form of communication.

If you have received any Cryptographic Units or are otherwise a Member, you consent and agree to become legally bound by this Agreement as both a participant in the DAO and more specifically a "DAO Member".

**Section 2.5 - Limitations.**  Status as a DAO Member does not (and shall not be deemed to) create, and the DAO does not (and shall not be deemed to) include, any authority, right or power on the part of a DAo Member to act as the agent, representative or attorney of or otherwise act on behalf of the DAO or any other Member, to bind the DAO or any other Member to any Contract or Liability or to convey any DAO Property or any asset, right or property owned or held by or on behalf of the DAO or any Member.

Neither party with a grievance against the other shall have recourse to litigation until the matter is submitted to mediation and attempted to be resolved in good faith.  All Members agree that there is a preference to settle disputes amongst Members or between Members and the DAO via decentralized dispute mechanisms in smart contract protocols.

## Community DOs and DON’Ts

To keep this Community productive, healthy, and welcoming, and to make it more likely we achieve our mission, we follow these Community *DOs* and *DON’Ts*.

**DO:**

* Treat everyone with respect, like you’d want to be treated.
* Be a good, kind, fair person.
* Disagree, debate, and discuss, but in a friendly, open-minded manner.
* Represent your point of view, but also be open to being wrong, be ready to change your mind, and be comfortable not getting your way.
* Take responsibility for your actions and admit your mistakes.
* Disclose any potential conflicts of interest.
* Prioritize the interests of this Community when participating in or contributing to this Community.
* Follow any of this Community’s rules related to confidentiality of information.

**DON’T:**
* Harass, bully, threaten, troll, abuse, or spam any person or any group.
* Let debates get personal.
* Misrepresent who you are, what you’re doing here, or your intentions.
* Post information you know is false, misleading, or inaccurate.
* Take credit for work that isn’t yours.
* Post or share personal or private information about another person.
* Try to damage or get unauthorized access to any system, data, password, or other information.

* Take any action that infringes or violates other people’s rights, violates the law, or breaches any contract or legal duty you have toward anyone or any institution.

## Enforcement

All members of this Community are responsible for ensuring that every other member follows this Code. If you witness a violation of this Code, please report it to an administrator or similar authority designated by this Community, which may include a registry or other protocol for automating disclosures and dispute resolution ("Administrators").

If you do not follow this Code, the Administrators can edit your Community posts and remove you from the Community, including reclaiming or slashing your Community assets.

* For the first minor offense, Administrators will issue a warning to the person.
* For the second minor offense, Administrators will issue a warning to the person and temporarily remove the person from the Community.
* For one serious offense or a third minor offense, Administrators will remove the person from the group permanently.

In enforcing these rules, Administrators will give the benefit of the doubt to the person accused of violating the rules and will err on the side of less enforcement. Whether to take any enforcement action is in the complete discretion of the Administrators.

## Waiver of Claims and Limitation of Liability

Administrators have no liability whatsoever for any enforcement action or lack of enforcement action.

If you are removed from this Community for any reason, no other member of this Community will be liable under contract, tort, strict liability, negligence, other legal or equitable theory, or otherwise for any indirect, incidental, punitive, consequential, special, or exemplary damages of any kind.

## Ratification

This Code may be ratified by this Community through a vote or similar form of consensus. In such case, bracketed terms shall be filled by reasonable inferences, including this Community's ledger, social media, and related records.

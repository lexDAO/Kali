### California Online Privacy Protection Act
 
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this Privacy Policy.

According to CalOPPA, {{Company Name}} agrees to the following:
 
— Users can explore the Services anonymously;
— Once this Privacy Policy is created, {{Company Name}} will add a link to it on its home page, or at a minimum, on the first significant page after entering the {{Company Name}} website central to the Services;
— The {{Company Name}} Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’, and can be easily be found on the page(s) specified above; and
— Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on the {{Company Name}} Privacy Policy page.
 
Users are able to change their personal information:
 
— By emailing {{Company Name}}.
